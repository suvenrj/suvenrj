# DocRoom Main Website
1) There's this sticky-note kind of helper-figure who follows you around and basically gives you information/help when you need it
2) Add flavour text. Stuff like "the portal you're building would probably require you to prioritise patients by date joined, to reward loyalty. Or the other way around."
3) Give hints to what lies beyond. Ajax calls, working with different languages and frameworks, and so on.

# DocRoom PMS Project
1) Appointment schedule (with mail/Whatsapp)
2) Integration with Map API (look at this later)
3) Introduce health parameters for patients. (If some parameter goes absurd, send patient a mail)
4) User tracking/guide- if the user does absurd things, guide him/her, or throw up and exception (doesn't need to be all-encompassing, just a case or two)
5) Making test cases and running them in django


Webdriver/selenium integration for tests/automation
